It doesn't matter what it was, where I saw it, or how clear a view I got. The situation's always the same.

I try to point the camera at the bird to capture that crisp image that will allay everyone's doubts that I really did see that rare species. The bird's right in front of me; how could I possibly blow it.

But when I try to see the bird in the camera's screen, all there is is an unfamiliar tangle of bush, tree, or weed. I try to line up with some distinctive branch or colourful leaf or something, then zoom in, lightly press the button to focus and then - still seeing no bird - snap.

And yes, these are some of my better ones. At least you can tell there's a bird there.

It's especially galling when it's a real goodie, like that last one (a White-eyed Vireo at Fort Needham Park).
